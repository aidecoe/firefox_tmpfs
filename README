Status

This script is just a rough draft.  Use at your own risk!  Remember to backup
profile directory before first run.  Later I'll rewrite it to better quality,
although I'm using the script on two machines with success. :-)

Any bug reports, patches, remarks are welcome!


Overview
~~~~~~~~

firefox_tmpfs at first run moves your (let reference your user name as $USER)
profile directory (let reference to it as $PROFILE) to the one suffixed with
".nv" (only if $PROFILE.nv doesn't already exist), mounts tmpfs on profile
directory and copies (rsyncs) all files from "$PROFILE" to "$PROFILE.nv".  On
next run when tmpfs is already mounted there, firefox_tmpfs syncs back changes
from $PROFILE on tmpfs to $PROFILE.nv which should reside on regular FS.
Sync-back operation is atomic thanks to atomic-rsync Perl script which is
expected to reside in /usr/share/rsync/atomic-rsync.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add following line to /etc/fstab.  Let assume $USER is user's name and $UID is
user's id.

  firefox_$USER  /home/$USER/.mozilla/firefox/$PROFILE  tmpfs  noauto,noatime,user,exec,uid=$UID,size=256m  0 0

Put firefox_tmpfs script somewhere in the $PATH which is also accessible for
cron.  Add following line to user's crontab (crontab -e).

  */10  *  *  *  *  firefox_tmpfs -s $PROFILE

It will sync back profile from "$PROFILE" to "$PROFILE.nv".  Next, add
following command to some DE autostart or .xsession (which is my case):

  firefox_tmpfs -b -n $PROFILE

It will backup $PROFILE.nv, and notify you when tmpfs dir is ready for use.
Don't run Firefox before it's ready!

rsync write log to $HOME/.firefox_tmpfs.log.  That should be all.  Have fun.
